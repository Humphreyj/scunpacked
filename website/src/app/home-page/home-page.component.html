    Welcome to Star Citizen速 Unpacked!
  </h4>

  <div class="text-gray-400 space-y-4">
    <p>
      This site aims to provide an easy way to browse and compare the various ships, vehicles, equipment, weapons and armour available in the game. I am still working
      on identifying and extracting all the necessary ship and item statistics, so if you find some stat is not listed please feel free to add an issue in GitHub
      and I'll do my best to add it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately there will also be a public API to make it easy for other websites to consume the data without having to go through the process of extracting
      the data from the game files first, but while I'm building the site, the data in the API is frequently changing, so it might be a bit frustrating to try
      and use it at the moment.

          This is a very small patch. The improved hull and nacelle strength of the <span class="text-white">Constellation</span> series has been walked-back a bit and
          the name of the <span class="text-white">Ares</span> was changed from "Ares Starfighter" to "Ares Star Fighter".

            The <span class="text-white">Constellation</span> series has received hull buffs. All critical sections of the ship have had their health buffed by a factor of 2 or even 4!
            It will be much harder to detach the nacelles too.
            Acceleration been has improved on all thrusters, but this has come at a cost: the SCunpacked estimated time till the tanks run empty has dropped from 7,600 seconds to just 2,961.
            Tweaks have also been made to "ground turbulence" and "precision max distance & landing multiplier", whatever they are :)
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="text-white">Terrapin</span> thrusters have been improved, the maneuvering thrusters in particular.
            Fuel capacity has been doubled to compensate for the increased fuel consumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            The maneuvering thrusters on the <span class="text-white">Herald</span> have been substantially buffed.
            No matching increase in fuel tank capacity though.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stock loadouts on the <span class="text-white">Talon</span> and <span class="text-white">Shrike</span> have been updated with different armour, coolers, powerplants, shields and quantum drive.
            The thrusters have received cooling improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The retro and maneuvering thrusters on the <span class="text-white">Prospector</span> have been buffed.
            No improvements to tank capacity or intake rate means the time to empty has dropped from 2,600 seconds to 2,100 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="text-white">Apocalypse Arms Predator Scattergun</span> has been added with 3466 physical damage per second.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="text-white">MaxOx NDB-30 Repeater</span> has been added with 532 energy damage per second.
          </p>
          <p>
            The size 1 Banu shield (also called <span class="text-white">Sukoran</span>) has been added. 6000 health, 270 regeneration.

          In cases where a ship's didn't fully specify the loadout of a component with sub-components, the loadout of the component itself is now used.
          This means that the cluster munitions in Rattler II missiles and a few strangely configured cargo grids are now correctly loaded.
